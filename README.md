# Welcome to WEkEO4Land

**wekeo4land** is a repository of Python and R based tools to introduce you to the use of land related data on the [WEkEO DIAS (Data Information
and Access System)](https://wekeo.eu/) and its Jupyter Lab. The content includes notebooks explaining WEkEO and the Jupyter Lab environment and
how to use the Harmonised Data Access (HDA) API that is fundamental to WEkEO. Within this repository are
tutorials and case studies, using data from the Copernicus Programme that are available on WEkEO.

The content provided is mostly based on [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which allow
a high-level of interactive learning, as code, text description and visualisation
is combined in one place.

The content of this repository is suitable for those completely new to WEkEO, Python, R, Copernicus data
and hosted processing environments.

## Repository overview

This repository is organized in different case studies: 

(i) land

(ii) ml-grassland-classification

(iii) snow&ice

For each case study a set of Copernicus data is introduced that is suitable for various applications and available via WEkEO.

## How to use this material

If you are on GitHub/Lab you can visit www.wekeo.copernicus.eu, register for an account and enter the JupyterLab - then follow the instructions below.

If you are currently on the WEkEO JupyterLab you're already in the right place and can start. To clone this repository in to the WEkEO JupyterLab environment open a terminal in the WEkEO JupyterLab, type

> `cd work`<br> > `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/wekeo/wekeo4land.git`<br>

This will create a clone of this repository of notebooks in the work directory on your Jupyterlab instance. You can use the same shell script to clone any external repository you like.

You can also use this code on your own computer/Jupyter Lab server, however you won't have the fast access provided by the Harmonized Data Access as part of the WEkEO infrastructure.
